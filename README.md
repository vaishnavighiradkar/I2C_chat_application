# I2C Chat Application Between Master and Slave 

## Aim

To create an I2C chat application between master and slave. 

## Purpose

We will learn how to establish communication between two arduino boards.   


## Components Required
- Arduino Uno Board - 2 
- Wires 

## Short Description 

- I am using two arduino boards and connecting their receiver and transmitter ends to establish connection between them.

## Workflow of the Project

- When the simulation is started and message is sent by user from one arduino, it will appear on serial monitor of second monitor as well as the first and vice versa. 

## Setup instructions

- Use Tinkercad
- Setup a circuit as shown in the circuit diagram in images folder
- Write the code as given
- Start simulation
- Enter any message.
- Change arduino board
- See the result
